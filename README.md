# 100days
Udemy 100 days of coding refresher. It's been a little while since I've touched python, using udemy's 100 days of python to get back in the game! 

Day 1 - 21 May 23
Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation and Variables
Well that was rather boring but good to my head wrapped around it again. I think it's more about remembering the basics and using git + manjaro + pycharm on a daily basis so I'll be ready in 10ish months to put these skills to use. Fun stuff, it's a little late in the day otherwise I'd do some more. Time to hang out with the kids, they want to watch the next Avengers movie..! Or maybe I do, and they're just along for the ride?
